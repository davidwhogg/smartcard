\section{why re-analyze \Kepler\ data?}

The \Kepler\ team is one of the most successful collaborations in the
history of astronomy, and the \Kepler\ data are by no means trivial to
understand and use.  Why would even a plucky twosome consider
competing with this extremely capable group?  The answer is that this
is \emph{not} a proposal to \emph{compete} with the \Kepler\ team.
This is a proposal to enhance the capabilities of the \Kepler\ mission
and give new tools to the entire community to increase the scientific
return from the \Kepler\ data (and many related and future data sets).

The first reason that it makes sense to re-consider the \Kepler\ data
from the ground up is the simple point that it is valuable to have
multiple eyes on the problem.  We bring different prejudices,
different intuitions, and different expertise than exists on the
\Kepler\ team.  In addition, we can analyze the \Kepler\ data in a
more open-ended way since we do not bear the responsibility of
delivering results according to existing schedules and requirements.
That said, we very much hope to create methods and code that make the
\Kepler\ team products more valuable and easier to deliver.

The second reason it makes sense for us to take an independent look at
the \Kepler\ data is that we will bring a strong probabilistic,
causal, generative model approach to everything we do.  In each
component of this project, we are trying to write down a probability
for the data given the parameters, and in each component we are trying
to have the relationship of the parameters to the predictions obey
deep ideas we have about the physical or causal processes that
generate the data.  For certain kinds of (endearing) fanatics---or
perhaps more correctly, under certain kinds of restrictive
assumptions---these probabilistic approaches to data analysis are
guaranteed to succeed over more heuristic methods.  We have god on our
side, in this sense.  But because we are free from project
requirements, we can take a more principled approach to the data
analysis and see if that delivers better results.  If it does (because
we are proposing to generate public, open-source, easy-to-use code)
\emph{everybody wins.}

Finally, the most important reason to bring new people and new ideas
to the \Kepler\ data is that the \Kepler\ data are so damned
important.  The vast majority of known exoplanets are
\Kepler\ discoveries (CITE), and each \Kepler\ discovery brings with
it so much important information about each planetary system (CITE).
The data set has included many multiple-planet systems, and supported
preliminary studies of population statistics, such as multiplicity and
inclination distributions (CITE).  These studies have been made
possible in part by the scale and in part by the simplicity of the
\Kepler\ experiment; it has created a statistically useable sample.
Although \Kepler\ is just the first step of \NASA's exoplanet journey,
it is the best data set in it's class right now, and will retain
unique capabilities for many years to come.  Furthermore, many future
data sets (for example that from \TESS; CITE), produce data that are
\Kepler-like in many ways.  \textbf{If we can take the most valuable
  data set in exoplanetary astrophysics and make it substantially more
  valuable with an ADAP-scale project, we can deliver to
  \NASA\ outstanding science per dollar.}

Even if you are convinced that the data need to be re-analyzed, why
should they be reanalyzed by this team?  Although the proposers do not
have a long history in exoplanet science, we do have some experience,
breaking ground in the area of hierarchical modeling of exoplanet
populations (CITE Hogg), and telescope light-field modeling for
exoplanet direct detection and spectroscopy (CITE Oppenheimer).  Much
more importantly, the proposal team has enormous experience in two
areas that are crucial if we are going to squeeze more information out
of the \Kepler\ data stream: We have great experience with calibration
and sensitive statistical analysis of enormous astrophysical data
sests (CITE some eg papers), and we are among the world leaders in
probabilistic modeling of astrophysical data sets (CITE some eg
papers).  In particular, Co-I Hogg was partially responsible for the
precise self-calibration of the \observatory{Sloan Digital Sky Survey}
imaging data (CITE Padmanabhan), which in turn led (almost directly)
to discoveries such as ultra-faint Milky Way companions Willman I
(CITE) and XXX (CITE) and the detection of the baryon acoustic feature
in the large-scale structure (CITE).  These two
strengths---calibration and probabilistic modeling---are not unique to
the proposing team, but their combination is unusual and puts us in a
very strong position to deliver extremely valuable new methods to the
\Kepler\ team and larger community.

\section{de-trending}

Key features of \project{untrendy}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Very scalable/local compared to ``Bayesian'' algorithm. Similar to
      a more robust windowed median.
\item Finds discontinuities---called Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Dropouts (SPSD)
      by the Kepler team---automatically and corrects the trends. There is a
      claim in the literature (with reference to a non-existent
      Kolodziejczak 2012 paper) that PDC in the Kepler pipeline 8.0 will deal
      with this but it's not included as part of the standard de-trending.
\item Untrendy is less robust to maintaining intrinsic stellar variability
      but it is
\end{itemize}

\section{management plan}

This project is the PhD dissertation project of Co-I Foreman-Mackey;
in this sense Foreman-Mackey is the scientific lead of the project,
making decisions about scientific priorities and the ordering of
experiments and code enhancements.  PI Hogg is the faculty advisor on
this dissertation; in this sense Hogg is the management lead of the
project, ensuring that deadlines get met, papers get written, and code
gets properly documented and released.  The budget also includes a
small amount of support for an additional part-time graduate student
and postdoc.  These are budgeted to support short-term scentific
collaborations that make use of the software or improve it.  That is,
some of the sub-parts of the project can be executed by new graduate
students or postdocs at NYU.

The project is budgeted for three years of project lifetime.  An
approximate schedule is the following

\paragraph{first year:}
Complete and release version~1.0 of \kplr\ API.  Release version~0.1
of \Untrendy, \Turnstile, and \Bart, executing the first stages of
approximation identified above.  Submit short papers describing these
codes, comparing them with standard community practice, and showing
first results.  Execute \Untrendy\ and \Turnstile\ on the entire \KIC;
publication of all candidate transiting exoplanets, especially those
previously unknown.  Execute \Bart\ on the best or most interesting of
those companions, with an eye to exoplanet characterization and
false-positive rejection.

\paragraph{second year:}
Submit papers describing the results of the \Untrendy, \Turnstile, and
\Bart\ from the first year.  Complete and release version~0.1 of
\TheCreator, executing the simplest meaningful graphical model, as
described above.  Execute \Bart\ and \TheCreator\ on the complete set
of exoplanet candidates geenerated in the first year.  Submit paper
describing those results.  With feedback from this full ``closed
loop'', re-prioritize enhancements to \Untrendy\ and \Turnstile; add
features to \Bart.  Complete and release Version~0.2 code for these
packages.  Start side projects on stellar variability, eclipsing
binaries, transit-timing variations, or limb-darkening as appropriate.

\paragraph{third year:}
Following up best hints in results from \TheCreator\ in the second
year, complexify or adjust the graphical model, or launch multiple
models for competition.  Re-run everything on the entire \KIC\ to
update the population analysis to incorporate all improvements.
Submit papers describing improved software and new results.  Complete
side projects and submit papers.  Make final decisions about final
code versions, final code adjustments, documentation, and hosting and
release Version~1.0 for all four of \Untrendy, \Turnstile, \Bart, and
\TheCreator, along with (possibly very short) papers on arXiv or ASCL.
